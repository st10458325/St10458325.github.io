                The International United Apostolic Faith Church (I.U.A.F.C) is an up-and-coming church founded by a 
                group of people who wished to spread love, healing and their faith in God. The church was founded
                in 2017 and formally established on the 5th of October 2021. As of yet the church has grown exponentially, spreading its 
                reach to neighboring countries like Botswana and Zimbabwe. The church has also grown in numbers 
                from being a small group of like-minded individuals to a vibrant and diverse congregation united in 
                faith and purpose.
